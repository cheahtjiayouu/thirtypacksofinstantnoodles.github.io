	<h2>Desserts</h2>
	  <h3>Ice creams</h3>
	  <h4>Vanilla Ice cream-Rm12.50</h4>
	  <h4>A silken quenelle of hand-churned vanilla ice cream, crafted from double cream sourced from grass-fed Normandy cows, infused gently with the seeds of Madagascar Bourbon vanilla pods—sun-cured and split mere hours before infusion. The custard base is cooked sous-vide to preserve the subtle floral notes and prevent over-emulsification, resulting in a texture that is simultaneously rich, airy, and velvety.</h4>
	  <h3>Chocolate Ice cream-Rm 13.10</h3>
          <h4>This artisanal ice cream is a study in intensity and refinement—crafted from 72% single-origin Ecuadorian dark chocolate, delicately tempered into a custard base of organic egg yolks and cream, slow-cooked to achieve a custard with the silken consistency of velvet. On the nose, a bouquet of roasted cacao, espresso, and faint black cherry rises. The palate opens with a bold bitterness, quickly enveloped by layers of deep cocoa, toasted hazelnut, and a trace of molasses. A hint of sea salt draws out the complexity of the chocolate, while a whisper of vanilla on the finish elevates and rounds the profile. Texturally indulgent, almost truffle-like in density, yet melting into silk upon the tongue,Served in its purest form.</h4>
	  <h3>Strawberry ice cream-Rm12.70</h3>
	  <h4>This seasonal creation captures the fleeting essence of peak-summer strawberries—handpicked at dawn from organic heirloom cultivars grown in volcanic soil. The berries are gently macerated with raw cane sugar to awaken their natural acidity, then folded into a crème anglaise base enriched with farm-fresh cream and a touch of buttermilk for brightness. The result is a delicate pastel pink with no artificial hue—just the honest blush of ripe fruit. On the palate, notes of wild strawberry, hibiscus, and a hint of balsamic unfold in perfect harmony, balanced by a rounded, creamy finish. Each spoonful recalls the texture of a just-bitten berry: yielding, juicy, ephemeral. Served simply, without garnish.</h4>
	  <h3>Cheesecake Rm 21.70</h3>
	  <h4>An aerated cheesecake crafted from single-origin Madagascar vanilla and artisanal cream cheese, gently baked in a bain-marie to achieve an impossibly smooth, cloud-like texture. The crust—a delicate sablé Breton infused with toasted almond and brown butter—offers a subtle crunch, grounding the dish with its nutty warmth. Served barely chilled to enhance the natural richness of the dairy, each bite reveals layers of restrained sweetness, floral vanilla, and a whisper of citrus zest. Accompanied by a brushstroke of Sicilian lemon gel and a quenelle of cultured crème fraîche, the dish is finished with a snow of freeze-dried raspberries to evoke contrast in both texture and acidity.</h4>
	  <h3>Chocolate cake-Rm 22.90</h3>
	  <h4>This rich yet refined cake is composed of 75% single-origin Venezuelan dark chocolate, folded into a velvety emulsion of farm-fresh eggs and cultured butter—baked just to the edge of set, where the interior remains molten and mousse-like. The absence of flour allows the purity of the chocolate to speak in full depth: earthy, bitter, with notes of espresso, tobacco leaf, and black cherry. A whisper of sea salt heightens the profile, while a dusting of raw cocoa powder adds a final, bittersweet kiss. Served warm, it rests on a smear of smoked crème anglaise and is paired with a quenelle of sour cherry sorbet, providing a sharp contrast to the cake’s decadence.</h4>
	  <h3>Trio Creampuffs-Rm16.90</h3>
	  <h4>Delicate pâte à choux, piped with architectural precision and baked to a golden, ethereal shell—crisp on the exterior, yielding within. Once cooled, the hollow is filled with a lightly whipped vanilla crème diplomate, made from Tahitian vanilla bean pastry cream folded with Chantilly, creating a texture that melts upon contact with the tongue. Each puff is lightly glazed with a mirror-finish sugar veil or dusted with a snow of confectioners’ sugar, evoking elegance without excess. Served as a trio, each bite-sized sphere delivers a contrast of crunch, cream, and air—a fleeting moment of buttery bliss.</h4>
	  <h3>Chocolate Fudge pudding-Rm35.50</h3>
          <h4>A deep, molten-centered pudding crafted from 70% single-origin Peruvian dark chocolate, enriched with cultured butter and aged vanilla extract. Baked to perfection, the exterior forms a delicate, brownie-like crust that gives way to a silken, flowing core of warm fudge. Served straight from the oven, it rests atop a smear of cocoa nib praline and is paired with a quenelle of sour cream ice cream to cut through the richness with a subtle tang. A whisper of smoked Maldon salt crowns the dish, coaxing out notes of roasted coffee, dark fruit, and toasted almond from the chocolate.</h4>
	  <h3>Strawberry fudge pudding-Rm 31.70</h3>
          <h4>A warm, slow-baked pudding with a molten strawberry fudge center, crafted from a reduction of Gariguette strawberries, white chocolate, and a touch of strawberry vinegar to preserve the fruit’s acidity. The base—a tender sponge infused with fermented strawberry purée—offers both moisture and depth, its crumb soaked lightly in a vanilla bean syrup to echo summer ripeness. Upon cutting, the core releases a glossy river of ruby-hued strawberry fudge, its texture silken and rich, yet lifted by the brightness of the fruit. It’s served with a basil-infused crème fraîche sorbet and garnished with dehydrated strawberry shards for a whisper of crunch and tartness.</h4>
	  <h3>Chocolate Soufflé-Rm 21.30</h3>
	  <h4>This dark chocolate soufflé is a symphony of rich 70% single-origin cacao, seamlessly integrated into a luxuriously smooth base and lifted by airy, whipped egg whites. The delicate crust yields to an intensely molten core, bursting with bittersweet depth, roasted cocoa notes, and a hint of espresso. Presented with a dusting of raw cacao and paired with a quenelle of chilled crème fraîche or a whisper of salted caramel sauce, it balances warmth and chill, lightness and richness.</h4>
	  <h3>classic vanilla soufflé-Rm20.90</h3>
	  <h4>A masterpiece of lightness and precision, this soufflé is crafted from a silky vanilla bean-infused crème anglaise base, delicately folded with meticulously whipped egg whites. Baked to rise with a golden, slightly crisp exterior that gives way to a cloud-like interior, it captures the pure essence of Madagascar vanilla—floral, creamy, and subtly sweet. Served immediately, its ephemeral nature melts effortlessly on the tongue, accompanied by a whisper of powdered sugar and a side of warm crème anglaise or a delicate vanilla bean sauce to complement without overpowering.</h4>
	  <h3>Quad Egg Tart- Rm 25.50</h3>
	  <h4>A refined reinterpretation of the classic egg tart, this version is enriched with four fresh, farm-raised egg yolks, lending a decadently silky custard that is luxuriously dense yet balanced by delicate sweetness. The custard is gently steamed to a flawless, glassy finish, showcasing a radiant golden hue reminiscent of liquid sunshine. Encased in a meticulously crafted, flaky pâte brisée crust with a whisper of browned butter, the tart offers a harmonious contrast—crisp and buttery against the melt-in-your-mouth custard. Lightly caramelized at the edges for subtle depth, it is served warm, accompanied by a citrus blossom syrup drizzle to brighten the richness.</h4>
	  <h3>Macarons(chocolate,lemon,strawberry,matcha,)-Rm21.50</h3>
	  <h4>A harmonious quartet presented on a single porcelain plate, this selection of macarons showcases four distinct yet complementary flavors. The bittersweet depth of the 70% single-origin dark chocolate ganache contrasts beautifully with the vibrant brightness of Sicilian lemon curd, while the smooth, floral strawberry cream offers a delicate sweetness that balances perfectly against the earthy, nuanced bitterness of matcha-infused white chocolate ganache. Each almond meringue shell is expertly baked to a crisp exterior that gives way to a tender, melt-in-the-mouth center, creating a refined interplay of texture and flavor—a sophisticated celebration of balance, artistry, and elegant contrast.</h4>
